SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
I done this through two ways due to lack of hardware components(arduino and leds),I done this throgh Pycharm using python code and tinkercad.

1.Pycharm(using python):
-Installed speech recognition library ,pyaudio to take my audio input.
-I included fan off,fan on,light off,light on in my oython code
-so when i run the code it ask me for input 
-when i say fan on it displays Fan is ON
-when i say fan off it displays Fan is OFF
-when i say light on it displays Light is ON
-when i say light on it displays Light is OFF

If we have arduino board we can write arduino code in arduino IDE and can interface this python code to the board and can observe the output.


2.Tinkercad
-Here I connected two Leds red named as Light and Blue named as Fan 
-connected Red LED to pin 2 and BLUE LED to pin 3 
-wrote code accoringlly
-by giving fan on ,fan off,light off,light on in serial monitor we can observe that RED(light) and BLUE(Fan) LED's will ON and OFF accordingly.
